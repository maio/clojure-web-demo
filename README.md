# Clojure & Web - simple Demo

The code in this repo was part of 'Clojure & Web' talk prepared by 
[Daniel Skarda](https://github.com/orfelyus). The talk was presented on [Prague Lambda Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Lambda-Meetup-Group/) 
on September 26th 2012. See [Google Presentation](http://goo.gl/nEFWB) for slides.

The goal of the talk was to give an overview of Clojure libraries for

* simple request handling (see 
  [Demo 1](https://github.com/lambda-prague/clojure-web-demo/blob/master/demo/demo-1-jetty))
* HTML generation using [Hiccup](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup) 
* request routing using [Compojure](https://github.com/weavejester/compojure) (see 
  [Demo 2](https://github.com/lambda-prague/clojure-web-demo/blob/master/demo/demo-2-compojure) and
  [Demo 3](https://github.com/lambda-prague/clojure-web-demo/blob/master/demo/demo-3-chat)).
* using ClojureScript for browser specific tasks
* deploying on Heroku
